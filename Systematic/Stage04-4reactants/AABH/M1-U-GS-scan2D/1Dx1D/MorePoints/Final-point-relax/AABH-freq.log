 PENOTUS DIED A HUNDRED YEARS OLD WANTING BUT TWO...
 AND HE USED TO SAY BEFORE HE DIED, HAVING SPENT HIS
 WHOLE LIFE IN VAINLY SEARCHING AFTER THE PHILOSOPHER'S
 STONE, THAT IF HE HAD A MORTAL ENEMY HE DID NOT DARE
 TO ENCOUNTER OPENLY, HE WOULD ADVISE HIM ABOVE ALL
 THINGS TO GIVE HIMSELF UP TO THE STUDY AND PRACTICE
 OF ALCHEMY.  --  NICOLAS LEMERY, M.D.
